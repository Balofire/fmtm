## Overview
This is just a brief document which highlights my suggestions on how best to reward hard working Open Source Contributors and motivate them to do more.

## Goals
1. To show contributors that their hard work has been acknowledged.
2. To motivate and give them a positive boost to keep up the good work.
3. To reward and stay updated with their progress.

# Rewarding Practices
- Weekly/monthly check ins, to stay up to date with the progress of the contributor as well as provide guidance and comfort. A warm verbal acknowledgment of said contributor’s achievements and possible enquiry about their well being.

- If funding is available, diligent contributors should be given company swag (keyholders, bottles, stickers, glasses, tote bags et cetera). It’s a nice ego boost for contributors and also serves as a form of advertising when in use.

- Offering tasks that cater to the contributors specific interests. People really enjoy recognition and would be happier and work better in their personal area of interest within the organization. Thus, rewarding the contributor and consequently improving the efficiency of the organization.

- Giving out referrals and recommendations for exceptional contributors who have great potential.

- Volunteer of the week/month badges for best volunteers of the week or month that are available for all other volunteers to see. This rewards the contributor and gives others something to work towards.
